You go above and beyond to make sure they're happy, and if someone is upset it's always the first thought on your mind. It's not just about family and friends though, you care about your impact on the planet and how you can help other people."

And even when we're not hiking in Switzerland or finding buffalo in South Dakota, just hanging out with you is awlays the most fun I ever have. Your friends obviously love you, and it's not shocking as to why. You'll always be the most interesting person in the world to me, I just want you to know that."

Your house, your suitcase, your cooking, your cards to me, all of it is placed in a way that shows your intention and focus. Your presentation is something I aspire to achive. I feel like sometimes I'll do 90% of a job really well and forget about the remaining portion, but you hit 110% every since time. Watching you work has made me a better person, and I hope you know that."
